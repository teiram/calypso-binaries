# Information
Atari ST core based on the MiSTery core that can be found [here](https://github.com/gyurco/MiSTery)
# Current status
The core boots and shows the GEM desktop. Can run games and demos quite properly.

Floppy speed is extremely slow.
ACSI emulation works a bit randomly. Sometimes they are properly detected and sometimes they are not.
# How to run
You need at least a TOS image. By default it must be named TOS.BIN and placed on the SD card root directory. If you don't want to wait for the TOS to timeout on no diskette inserted on drive A you should also provide a DISK_A.ST file on the root directory of the SD card.
