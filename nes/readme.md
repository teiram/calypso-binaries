# Information
NES core, ported from the [MiST NES Core](https://github.com/mist-devel/nes)
# Current status
Works mostly properly but sometimes you might get a blank screen (with working sound). It seems to randomly happen when the core boots or a new game is loaded. Once the game is loaded it seems to work properly. Can be related to my monitor not properly handling 60hz or maybe something is wrong with the core. The PLL frequencies could be a bit off.

# How to run
Drop the RBF file in the root of the Calypso SD card. Once it't running press F12 to call the OSD and select a game ROM. The game should start immediately.

You can use a DB9 joystick to run the games.
