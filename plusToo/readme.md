# Information
Macintosh Plus core, ported from the [MiST Core](https://github.com/mist-devel/plus_too) what is based on [this implementation](https://www.bigmessowires.com/2012/12/15/plus-too-files/)
# Current status
Video and audio works. I found no issue with this core so far.
# How to run
You will need a Classic/Plus ROM named as plus_too.rom in the SD card root. Use the OSD (F12) to select floppy drives or hard drive images.
