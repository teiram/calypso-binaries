# Information
Sinclair ZX80/ZX81 port based on the [BigMiST Core](https://github.com/BigMist/Sinclair_ZX8X)
# Current status
No known issues at this point.
# Limitations
The ZX80/ZX81 computers generates syncs only when not in the so-called fast mode. This makes modern monitors struggle a lot, specially when using the VGA output. The composite output of the Calypso can be used with better results, but restricted to B/W (no chroma81 support yet) 
# How to run
No extra files (just the rbf) are needed to run this core
