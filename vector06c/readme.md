# How to run (from the original documentation)

ROM files are started automatically after loading.
- After loading FDD or EDD files, BOOT ROM will be activated. You need to press ALT-F11 to start the disk if it's bootable. If disk is not bootable then you need to load additionally EDD or ROM file with MicroDOS and then follow the MicroDOS guide.
- Some applications on disks require Quasi-disk to be formatted (and refuse to work if not). In this case, you need to hold CTRL and shortly press ALT+F11 key combination to automatically format Quasi-disk at MiscroDOS startup.
- If both EDD and FDD are loaded then EDD has priority by default. To switch to FDD you need to hold down SHIFT+F1+F2 and quickly press F11
